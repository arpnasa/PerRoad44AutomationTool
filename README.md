# PerRoad44AutomationTool
This tool automates the input entry and stores the generated output in the desired path. The input is assumed to be taken from excel.

To implement this tool in your own system, clone the project and change the path of the software and other paths in the config file. 

And in the rarest case, if the tool seems to malfunction, then first rerun the script 3 to 4 times and see if it resolves the issue. If it doesn't, then adjust the sleep time in the respective script files.
